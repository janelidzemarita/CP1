Problem 1.1
Derivatives and their applications.  (4 points)
1.  Give three examples of derivative’s application.
2.  Select one example, use finite differences or compact finite differences,code and visualize


Problem 1.2
Visualizing derivatives and smoothing filters (4 points) .  
Consider
1.  FD formulas for first order derivatives
2.  FD formulas for second order derivative
3.  Smoothing filter
4.  Can linear combination of second order derivatives with differentspacing and function value itself work as smoothing filter?
5. Test:
 ▶Investigate impact of precision (single, double) and spacing
 ▶Demonstrate accuracy of computations on test problem.
 ▶Explain obtained results.
 
 Problem 1.3
 Computing derivatives on cubed sphere (4 points)
 1.  Construct cubed sphere mesh.
 2.  Consider f(x,y,z) on a sphere.  Which derivatives off can you compute on cubed sphere using function values in nodal points only?
 3.  Define stencil and consider linear combination of function values.  Does it converge when grid spacing vanishes?
 4.  Test:  Demonstrate convergence of selected formula to derivatives as mesh spacing vanishes.  Visualize.

Problem 1.4

Examples of Derivative's application


1. Physics: 
--> In physics, derivatives are commonly used to analyze motion and calculate velocities and accelerations. 
For instance, if you have a position-time function, taking the derivative of that function with respect to time gives you the velocity function, and taking the derivative of the velocity function gives you the acceleration function.

2. Economics: 
--> Derivatives are extensively used in economics to analyze rates of change and optimize functions. 
For example, in microeconomics, the marginal cost is the derivative of the cost function with respect to the quantity produced. 
It helps determine the additional cost incurred by producing one more unit of a good or service.

3. Image Processing: 
--> Derivatives play a crucial role in image processing techniques such as edge detection. 
By calculating derivatives of pixel intensities in an image, you can identify areas of significant changes, which correspond to edges between objects or regions. 
This is widely used in computer vision applications.
